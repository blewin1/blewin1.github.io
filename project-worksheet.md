## Project Description

This project will be a portfolio website to show who I am, and show some projects I've completed.

Some examples of features I will include:

| Link to Site | Feature to be used 
|---|---|
https://mattfarley.ca/ | Projects grid and hover
https://sebkay.com/contact/ | Contact Layout
http://eloise-ress-barrow.surge.sh/index.html | footer layout and header layout


Other features I'd like to include:

- Top Nav disappears when scrolling on mobile, but reappears at any page location when you scroll back up
- Nav menu auto highlighting on desktop and tablet

Wireframes can be seen below.

## Google Sheet

Project is linked in the google sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UnhpYCWFX9LxGuhoe5E1K74271K-VAcVojIuR0XM57A/edit#gid=0)

## Wireframes

Mobile Wireframe:

- Single page design
- Top nav with hamburger menu (menu opens full screen width not shown)
- All elements are stacked

Desktop/Tablet Wireframe:

- The only difference between Desktop and Mobile is that the project grid changes dimensions
- The header and footer are always visible, page scrolls within them
- Nav bar ideally includes auto highlighting as you scroll through the page

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Link]()

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Hamburger Menu
- Responsive Nav
- Project Grid w/ hover descriptions
- Contact form
- Icons on footer

#### PostMVP 

- Nav Autohighlight
- Nav buttons smooth scroll
- Mobile Nav Scroll Away and back
